# Role-Based-Access-Control-RBAC-
This project implements a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It supports user authentication (registration and login) with JWT tokens and assigns roles (Admin, User, Moderator) for managing access. It uses bcryptjs for password hashing and enforces authorization via middleware based on roles
